# Librarian-Assistant
Project for CPTS 322

This project is about developing a librarian assistant that helps a librarian manage common
library-management tasks, including user registration, book search, placing hold on a
book, checking out a book, and returning a book, etc. You may need to use a database
of book information to support this application. Users can also browse the books in the
library and look into the details about each book selected. The user interface could be a
desktop application or a website portal.

The people who are working on this Project are myself(Jacob Smith), Lucas, Ali, Austin, and Tay.
